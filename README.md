MacNagios
=========

Nagios status bar monitoring tool for MacOS X.

Have you ever wished that you could just look at the top right corner of your Mac desktop and see a little icon and a number that indicated how your servers were doing?  And if something went wrong, get a little message in your notification center that says what happened?  Wish no more, my friend - MacNagios is just that ~~and more~~!

Installation - Client
=====================

* Download the binary, links below.
* Unzip it and copy/move the application to your Applications folder.
* Create a macnagios-config.plist file in either your home directory or in /etc/
* Example config file:

		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
		<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
		<plist version="1.0">
		<dict>
		
			<key>NotifyOnChange</key> <!-- should we send messages to the notification center -->
			<true/>
		
			<key>NotifyWithSound</key> <!-- should our messages also include a sound? if NotifyOnChange is false, this will do nothing -->
			<true/>
		
			<key>SkipIfNotificationsDisabled</key> <!-- if true, then services which have notifications disabled are skipped and not considered -->
			<true/>

Note that you'll need to add the statusJson.php file on the Nagios server, see below.

Server Setup
============

For status information, MacNagios uses statusJson.php: https://github.com/lizell/php-nagios-json

Installation is really simple:

* Find the folder that has your nagios index.php in it (generally something like /usr/share/nagios/) and download a copy of statusJson.php, like so:

		curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lizell/php-nagios-json/master/statusJson.php' > statusJson.php

* Edit the top of statusJson.php to have the correct path to your Nagios status.dat file


Downloads
=========
(MacOS X 10.9+ 64-bit / in theory it should work on 10.8, but not tested)

FAQ
===

Since I'm writing this this document as I'm first releasing the software, the total number of questions I've received is zero.  With a static frequency of zero for all questions, the only thing that made sense was to list whatever came to mind, in random order:

### I run it but I just get 0 OK, 0 Warn, 0 Crit as the status

MacNagios is not able to pull the status information.  For now, the best way to debug is to just run the app manually from the command line - it will tell you what's wrong on the console.  E.g. open a terminal and type:

		/Applications/MacNagios.app/Contents/MacOS/MacNagios

And you'll probably see stuff like "Error while getting URL..." - which you should be able to debug from there.

### Does MacNagios report on hosts?

No, MacNagios only reports on services and currently ignores host statuses.  In all of the configurations I've seen this works out okay, and that's all I had time to code.  Hopefully it works for you as well.

### Why do I have to edit a config file? - this is a Mac app!

Well, this is sysadmin tool.  If you don't know how to edit a config file, you very likely don't need this app.

### Are you Scottish?
No.  But the program might be, considering it's name.

MacNagios was written by Brad Peabody.  Inspired by NagiosDock (http://nagiosdock.sourceforge.net/), I needed something more up to date that just made it simple for me to get the feedback on multiple nagios instances easily from my Mac workstation.
